**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

So far, throughout this CS program, I have learned that to ensure my program is functional and secure is by handling errors, ensuring it meets requirements, and thinking of possible scenarios that my program can run into through testing. For example, in Software security, certain attacks are through DoS, or injection that exploits gaps/erros in code or scenarios that the code can get into. Or just through use, missing a non functional requirement can cause errors and a possible software shutdown due to the fact that certain requirement was not tested or not met. Therefore, by following those principles and many others, I can ensure that my program is functional and secure. 

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

By placing them in different categories- Functional vs Nonfunctional requirements, it can help interpret user needs. And that way, it can easily be translated into the program by following and ensuring those requirements are met throughout. Basically using those requirements as a guide of the program; if a certain feature does not meet or enhance those requirements, it is not necessary to be in the program and can cause more harm than good since it is a new variable that the client did not think of. 


**How do I approach designing software?**

As I learned, the best way to approach designing software is by staying client centered, objective thinking, focusing on requirements, quality testing, and good communication with the team. Those are just a few good foundations out of many to have in approaching to design software. Since at the end of the day, the project is for the client, and if the client is happy with the project, the project is secure and functional by testing, and the team worked together well on it, then the other buisness side of things goes smoothly as well. A good approach in designing software causes a domino affect throughout.
